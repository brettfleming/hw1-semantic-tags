# hw1-semantic-tags

task: The main task of this project was to fix the semantic tagging and adding the alt elements to the images. 

This is my first project for the bootcamp, and I worked on semantic tagging. Looking at the code it looked and worked fine at a glance but when looking at it in more depth I noticed that it could easily be imporved upon. The first thing that needed to change was the semantic tags they orinal code only used div as there primary tags, I changed this by adding in some header, footer, and section tags. I also noticed that all the images didnt ahve any alt tags, so any viewer that could not see would not get the full experice of the website. so i added descriptive alt tags to all of the images on the website. The last thing that I worked on was the CSS file, there was nothing wrong with it, just noticed that it could be condensed down a bit, and I created some need classes, so that I could combine some of the CSS styling code together. I did leave the old classes and only commented out the CSS lines of code, so that if they needed to make changes in the future they would be able to do so with ease.
